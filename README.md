Lightweight UI framework for projects created in Unreal Engine 4. 
Based on UMG. It's free to use, even commercially.

### Goals
* Speed up prototyping.
* Reduce boilerplate in UMG scripts.
* Provide typical UI composites (i.e. checkbox with text label - used to set game options). 
* Provide samples of Main/Options menus.
* Easy to extend.
* Promote good practices.

### Framework folders
* \Gameplay (basic input files)
* \UI 
* \UI\Composites (common interactive elements)
* \UI\Icons (placeholders)
* \UI\Panels (sample panels)

### Sample Project
* \Generic (these assets could be used for quick mockups)
* \Maps (few simple maps for prototyping) 
* \Modes (few simplified game templates)

### Third-party assets used in sample project
* Controller icons [created by Xelu](http://opengameart.org/content/free-keyboard-and-controllers-prompts-pack).
* Miscellaneous icons:  [To [icon]](http://www.toicon.com/about)
